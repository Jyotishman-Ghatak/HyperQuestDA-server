## HyperQuest Server

Contains the server side code for HyperQuest.
HyperQuest is a web-app used by beginners in ML to easily get a proper intuition for choosing the right hyperparameters. This is initally an extremely daunting task because not having proper hyperparameters lead to the models breaking down.

Started as a project for DSC DAIICT's SLoP. Interested student contributors will get some knowledge of Flask/Node.js (undecided), a little bit of ML using Pytorch, and a NoSQL DB.
